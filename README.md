<h2 align="center">Hello everyone! My name is Clay Hickman ðŸ‘‹.</h2>
<p align="center">I'm currently a student pursuing my Bachelor's of Information Technology in Cloud Computing, and I'm concentrating on the fundamental elements within it's infrastructure. This GitHub hosts some of my Cloud deployment projects that integrate a variety of software to reinforce my understanding and incorporate intergral skills, as well as my explorations of Git/DevOps and SRE practices to optimize infrastructure and operations. You'll typically find me residing in a terminal within some Linux/Unix operating system (RHEL, Debian and FreeBSD as of lately), refining my programming/scripting (Bash, Python and Go) abilities and studying for coursework/certifications.</p>

<p align="center">My other interests; I'm an avid reader (I'd love to hear your book recommendations!), a horticulturist (formerly commercial), a mediocre yogi, an "once-again" cyclist, and an amateur radio operator ("CQ CQ K4XOB").</p>
